This is a project which will be submitted for Assignment 4

It is a discord bot that will post a picture of a dog in chat if a user types "dog",
If a user types "cat" in chat, the bot will post a picture of a cat, these were derived from the dog and cat api's


Since discord detects if the bot token is published to the public, it will delete that token, if the token in the python file does not work
I can provide another, as I do not know when they will revoke the token i used
